                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For working people, it is very tough to give attention to their health. Your health and performance at work can be affected by spending long periods at your desk or eating unhealthy snacks. You can learn how to stay energised and productive throughout the day by understanding your needs and making healthier choices.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">You must take a break from the robotic routine and pick healthy habits if you are a person who remains busy with work and other matters.</p>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Balanced Diet</h3>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">A nutritious and balanced diet is essential to keep your body well-nourished. Healthiness of your inner system depends on the food you eat. Furthermore, it aids in assessing your mental ailments and psychological well-being. Lacking in vital nutrients your body can cause serious health issues. Moreover, you end up experiencing emotional distress and anxiety. According to health and wellness experts fruits and vegetables should be eaten in sufficient amounts.

                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Drink Water</h3>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Drinking water can keep you alert and fired up all day long. Many people aim to drink eight to 10 glasses of water per day, but the amount each person needs can vary depending on the level of physical activity and the climate. You can keep your body hydrated by replacing your usual coffee or soda with a glass of water. You can stay full and resist the temptation to snack by drinking more water at work.</p>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Workout</h3>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Staying active and working out every day boosts your circulation throughout your body. The increased blood flow makes you feel more energetic, fresh, and mentally active. It is important to exercise to keep your body fit and healthy. A simple walk with your pet or a daily morning walk is enough. The most important thing is to make it a daily habit.&nbsp;</p>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Sound Sleep</h3>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">It is essential to get enough sleep to maintain optimal productivity and overall health. Adequate sleep is important for improving memory, concentration, and decision-making abilities. Many busy entrepreneurs sacrifice sleep in order to meet the demands of their work. In the long run, prioritising sleep can actually help boost productivity. Besides, creating a sleep-friendly environment and making a bedtime routine can help the body to prepare for sleep. Today, due to the change in lifestyle, many people are not able to sleep and some are getting insomnia. Kapiva has introduced a range of natural products that are helpful in many health problems like PCOS, weight issues, hairfall, sleep and many more with no side effects.

                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Good Posture</h3>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Sitting at a desk for a long time can strain your neck, shoulders, and spine. Good posture and stretching throughout the day can ease this stress. You can do postural stretches from your desk. Take note and adjust yourself if you notice you're leaning into your screen or hunched over. Like, it is recommended to maintain your computer screen at eye level and approximately one arm's length away from you. Moreover, using larger font sizes or display settings to avoid straining your eyes.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Health and wellness cannot be achieved overnight. It is a constant process that is good for health and mind.
