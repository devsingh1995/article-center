Therefore, every spectacle holder should maintain hygiene to protect their sensitive eyes from attracting dirt and germs from their spectacles.</p>

                            <h2>Tips And Tricks For Maintaining Eyeglasses</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Here are some tips and tricks for you to keep your spectacles in good condition.</p>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Wash and Rinse</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Washing the lenses of your spectacles and frame with plain tap water is the first and most important step to take whenever you feel too much dirt sticking to your lens. After washing, rinse the lenses and frame carefully to remove water droplets and their marks.</p>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Spray</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Use spray to clean your lenses daily to maintain the shine. You can get spray to clean your spectacles from your nearby spectacle showroom. You can also buy the cleaning solution online from Lenskart.</p>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Dry Spectacles</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Never leave your spectacles wet after washing them or using spray on them. Immediately rinse and clean it until it is dry. Leaving it with water droplets and spray can harm the lenses and frame too. Carefully dry the complete frame and then use it or keep it somewhere safe.</p>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Wipe With Cotton Cloth</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">You must have noticed people asking if someone has a cotton cloth to clean their spectacles. Because pure cotton is the best cloth to clean dirt or water from your lenses. It soaks up the water or cleaning solution without damaging the lens.</p>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Use Both Hands to Remove Spectacles</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Many people have the habit of wearing or taking off spectacles with their hands. This method slowly distorts the shape of your frame, making it difficult to use. It may also lead to bad eyesight due to the incorrect placement of spectacles.</p>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Place It Properly</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Whenever you take off your spectacles, put them carefully on a safe surface and in the correct position. Placing your spectacles on a rough surface or in an incorrect position can damage them, which is not safe for your eyes for a long time.</p>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Store in Case</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Always keep your spectacle case near you so that you can keep them in it whenever you no longer need them. The case will ensure the safety of the spectacles and keep them away from dirt.</p>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Grip Firmly</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Hold your spectacles carefully and not loosely to ensure stability while wearing or taking them off. Your grip contributes to either their safety or their damage. With a firm grip, make sure you are consciously handling the spectacles.</p>
                            <h2>Don&rsquo;ts to Follow For Clean Spectacles</h2>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Don&rsquo;t Touch The Lens</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Touching lenses leaves patches, making them dull, which ultimately reduces their quality. Instead, always hold your spectacles from the side sticks or from the intersection part very carefully.</p>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Don&rsquo;t Wear Spectacles During Sports</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Wearing spectacles during sports can hurt your eyes badly when something hits them with force. Either avoid wearing glasses in this case or switch to contact lenses for a better and safer view.</p>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Don&rsquo;t Treat Your Spectacles As Your Sunglasses</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Putting your glasses over your head can damage your spectacles. The shape will change over time if it is not kept safely.</p>
